## Hello!
I'm a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science** at **Berkeley**. I'm also pursuing the [Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation](https://bcdi.berkeley.edu). I'm graduating in May 2022!

In addition to coding, I love telling stories with illustration and data science. [Check out my projects.](./projects)

I grew up in Evanston, Illinois, but have lived in 10 cities throughout my childhood.
When I'm not working, I enjoy watching movies, trying new coffee, and reading sci-fi novels.
