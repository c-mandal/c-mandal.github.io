## Hello!
I'm a third year majoring in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I'm also pursuing the [Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation](https://bcdi.berkeley.edu) and plan to graduate in Spring 2022.

I'm interested in **backend engineering**, **data science**, **natural language processing**, and **user interface design**. I'm currently a software engineering intern at Apple. [Learn more about my technical experience.](./#experience)

In addition to coding, I love digital design and data science. [Check out my projects.](./#projects)

I'm a TA for CS61B, Berkeley's Data Structures course. [Look through my teaching materials.](./#teaching)

I'm originally from Evanston, Illinois but have lived in 10 cities throughout my childhood. 
When I'm not working, I enjoy watching movies, drinking cold brew coffee, and reading sci-fi.
