Hello! I'm a third year majoring in Computer Science in the College of Letters & Science at UC Berkeley. I'm also pursuing the [Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation](https://bcdi.berkeley.edu) and plan to graduate in Spring 2022.

I'm broadly interested in backend engineering, data science, natural language processing, and human computer interaction. I'm currently a software engineering intern at Apple. [Learn more about my technical experience.](./experience)

I'm a TA for CS61B, Berkeley's Data Structures course. [Look through my teaching materials.](./teaching)

In addition to coding, I love digital design and data science. [Check out my projects.](./projects)

I'm originally from Evanston, Illinois but have lived in 10 cities throughout my childhood. 
When I'm not working, I enjoy watching movies, drinking cold brew coffee, and reading sci-fi.
