## The Maggi Project

*(under construction)*

Inspired by an instagram post, I sought to answer a seemingly simple question:
> Can you tell a lot about a person by if they like their Maggi dry or soupy?

Maggi is a popular instant noodle dish in South Asian countries and the diaspora. I made a Google Forms survey asking mostly college students how they liked their Maggi, and a handful of other random questions such as:
- Where is your hometown?
- Where is your city of origin?
- Are you an immigrant?


### The Process
I cleaned and analyzed the data with Python, using `pandas`. I used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for early data visualizations and `folium` and `opencages` for geolocation and maps. 

I sought to represent the data with playful and understandable visuals. I take inspiration from data journalist [Mona Chalabi](https://monachalabi.com), who emphasizes showing uncertainty in data with hand-drawn elements. I drew the visuals on my iPad with [Procreate](https://procreate.art).
