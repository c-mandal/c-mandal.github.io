## EthiCAL Apparel Design Portfolio

EthiCAL Apparel is a student-run design organization for social good at Berkeley. I am an associate on the design team and participate in 2-3 product releases per semester where I create original apparel, stickers, and prints depicting everything from sustainability themes to life at Berkeley. 

EthiCAL donates ~60% of its profits to local organizations fighting for environmental justice, water conservation, and worker's rights, to name a few causes. Through my time in the club I've learned a lot about the design process including ideation, critique, and working within production constraints and deadlines. I've also gained insight on marketing and responsibly sourcing materials for apparel printing and shipping by working with our marketing and sales teams.

|This design is EthiCAL's first print available on our online store. I was inspired by classic illustrations of constellations and star maps.|
